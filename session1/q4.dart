/*
Question 4
How can you declare a variable in Dart to store a person's age and ensure it can
only hold integer values? Write the code.
*/
void main() {
  int personAge;
  // personAge = "ad.ad";
  // personAge = 15.5;
  personAge = 5;
}
// so i don't need to know the program give me error and the program not implement 
// but if i take the value from input use try-catch
